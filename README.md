# Description
The project is designed to generate a team profile through a Node.js application that incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest. The application prompts users with questions via the terminal, and the responses are used to populate an HTML page that is generated by the program.
The project is built with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, along with Node.js framework and Inquirer.js library for collecting user input. The application follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and employs Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology through Jest tests.
